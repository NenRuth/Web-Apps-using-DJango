# Web-Apps-using-DJango
Building interactive websites


A web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and to make journal entries
as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page describes the site and invite users to either register or log
in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.

#update, after a couple of dayzzzzz, web app is live at https://web-apps-using-django.onrender.com/

So, I: 

i. Built models (Topics & Entries)
ii. Created views and templates
iii. Added user registration and authentication
iv. Styled with Bootstrap
v. DEPLOYED TO THE INTERNET!
