# Web-Apps-using-DJango
Building interactive websites


A web app called Learning Log that allows users to log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and to make journal entries
as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page describes the site and invite users to either register or log
in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics, add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.
